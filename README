This is a practice project Code Along for Building a Room Scrape
As taught by Avi on Learn.co at :
https://learn.co/tracks/full-stack-web-development-v8/module-8-orms-and-activerecord/section-1-orms/video-review-codealongbuilding-a-room-scraper-and-orm

Most of this was following along with what Avi was doing. Commenting out entire classes to play around with the code.

Going to use this for practice when building relational ORM's in the near future.
